# The-AIDS-Group-Tial-Study-320
SAS code for analysis of the effect of IDV treatment among HIV-infected people

Summary:
•	Fit exponential distribution models for the data “time to AIDS defining or death” in each treatment groups
•	Plot the Kaplan-Meier estimators of the survival functions to assess the exponential distribution models 
•	Use the log rank test to determine whether the survival experience for the two treatment groups differs
•	Fit Cox proportional hazards regression models with different predictors to determine the effects of IDV treatment on AIDS
